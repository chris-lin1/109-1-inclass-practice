## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r}
a <- 2
a = 2 # = 與 <-同義
```

```{r}
3 -> b
```

{r}
```
```{r}
'我的年紀'=20

my_age='我的年紀'
```


```{r}
my_108_total_credits <- 15
my.108.total_credits <- 15
.my.108.total_credits <- 15
`.108.total_credits` <- 15
```
